Description: Tracks specified git repos for sysadmins
 git-keeper is a tool to help sysadmins track the status of specified git
 repositories on a server. It checks if the repositories are clean (no
 uncommitted changes) and if they are up-to-date with their remote
 counterparts.
 .
 git-keeper also provides a systemd service and timer, to help display
 status information in the message of the day (MOTD). This is useful
 for reminding sysadmins to clean and update their repositories.
